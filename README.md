# TCR-MHC-CD4_kinetic_modeling
Mathematical modeling for the study "Cooperative binding of TCR and CD4 to pMHC enhances TCR sensitivity"

The code provided encompasses modeling of: 
1. time dependent 2D adhesion frequency
2. zero-force kinetics from thermal fluctuation assay
3. force-dependent kinetics from BFP.

Software requirements are:
1. Matlab 2020a 
2. Julia 1.6

The code was tested on Windows 10, in the Matlab 2020a IDE and the VSCode v1.63.2 environment.

Datasets used in the analysis are provided in the respective subfolders
